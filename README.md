**Components Needed:**

- Arduino Uno
- 8 Resistors
- Breadboard
- 18 Jumper Cables

- USB Cable

**Software Used:**

 Arduino IDE

**Workshop Skill Break-up**

50 % Hardware and 50 % Software

**Workshop Overview**

Capacitive touch allows a circuit to be completed by the touch of a human's finger. This is a hardware-based workshop to inspire interest in electrical circuits as well as to start programming on Arduino. It is based on the invention kit called MaKey MaKey which is an Arduino-based microcontroller board, it allows extremely simple connections. We will be emulating this by capacitive touch principle. 

In this workshop, we will play the piano by touching flowers, control a video game using hand-drawn sketches and make a light switch with capacitive touch. 

**Pre-Workshop Steps**

Download Arduino IDE

Python 2.7 and Pip installed.

**Steps:**

1. Download the Makey\_DIY zip folder and save it.

2. Go to Piano capacitive touch folder, refer to the Fritzing circuits

3. Make sure to use 1 mega ohms resistors.

4. Connect the end of your crocodile clips to a conductive object.

5. Make sure your circuit is connected accordingly to the Fritzing circuits.

6. Go to Piano Capacitive Touch \&gt; Piano Arduino.ino. Open it.

7.Go to Tools, and make sure it is Board: &quot;Arduino/Genuine Uno&quot;.

8.Also make sure your port is selected as &quot;Arduino/Genuine Uno&quot;.

9.Click on the &quot;Upload&quot; button on the toolbar of your Arduino IDE.

10.Open the MakeKeyboard.py file with an editor of your choice &amp; make  sure the port number is same as Arduino. For example it might be &quot;COM9&quot;.

11. Navigate to MakeKeyboard file and open it. Keep it running in the background.

12. Navigate to the &#39;Application + Sound Files&#39; folder. Open the AKey file.

13. Have fun!

2. Software Setup

Part a :

- Adding the Library [https://github.com/arduino-libraries/CapacitiveSensor/zipball/master](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/CapacitiveSensor/zipball/master)
- Download the zip folder
- We go to the location where it is stored and copy the folder
- Then we navigate to Documents Arduino Libraries
- Paste the folder there
- Then we go back to Arduino and select Sketch Tab Include Library Add Zip Library and Select same as before from Documents Arduino Libraries CapactiveSensor File
